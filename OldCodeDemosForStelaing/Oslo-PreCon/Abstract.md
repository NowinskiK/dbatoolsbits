# PowerShell and SQL with Drew and Rob
 
Since Microsoft announced the sqlserver PowerShell module with the July release of SSMS more and more people have been using PowerShell to help them to administer their SQL Servers.  

The SQL Server Collaborative organisation have created the free, open source PowerShell module dbatools lead by Chrissy LeMaire and with over 100 contributors to extend PowerShell support for SQL Server even further, there is also dbachecks enabling configurable SQL estate validation using PowerShell as well as many other open source additions

## Who are we ?

Drew is an awesome fella  who I admire so much  

Rob is a SQL Server DBA with a passion for PowerShell, Azure, Automation, and SQL (PaaS geddit?). He is a Cloud and Data Center MVP and an officer for the PASS PowerShell VG and has spoken at and volunteered at many events. He is a member of the committee that organises SQL Saturday Exeter, PSDay.uk and also the European PowerShell Conference. He is a proud supporter of the SQL and PowerShell communities.  

He relishes sharing and learning and can be found doing both via Twitter and his blog. He spends most of his time looking at a screen and loves to solve problems. He knows that looking at a screen so much is bad for him because his wife tells him so. Thus, you can find him on the cricket field in the summer and flying a drone in the winter.
He has a fabulous beard.
